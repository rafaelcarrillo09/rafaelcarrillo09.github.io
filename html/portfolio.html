          <h3><strong>Overview:</strong> 
          </h3>
          <li><strong>Summary:</strong> In my IN4MATX 133 class, I was assigned the task of creating my own personal website out of scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This website had to be well designed, functional, responsive, and accessible.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Design Question:</strong> How might we design a fully responsive and accessible website that fully represents my interests and skills? </li>
          <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Create a fully responsive and accessible website with good design that fully represents me and my interests and skills</li>
          <li><strong>Roles:</strong> Front-end Developer, Front-end Designer, Researcher</li>
          <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Approximately 2 weeks</li>
          <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Sublime Text, Figma, Github, Accessibility Checker</li>
          <h3><strong>Process:</strong></h3>
          <li><strong>Initial Steps:</strong> First, I sought out inspiration by researching existing personal websites created by professionals. This gave me a good overview of what a personal website should look like. Then, I researched what a responsive and accessible website looked like and how it was structured. Next, I developed a list of topics I wanted to include in my website. Finally, I made a mockup design of what I wanted my website to look like.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Methods/Tools Used:</strong> I followed the 10 Usability Heuristics of UI in order to design my website. I also used an html and css accessibility checker when creating my website to assure it was accessible to all. I used Sublime Text to code my website and Google to test its responsiveness. 
          </li>
          <h3><strong>Outcome:</strong></h3>
          <li><strong>Final product:</strong> This website is the final product of my research, design, and programming skills. I use Github to host my website and Sublime Text to maintain and edit the legacy code.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Takeaways / Moving foward:</strong> I learned a lot about how websites should be structured and how design principles help designers maintain good designs online. I learned how to develop using html, css and javascript, as well as how to design using Figma. Moving foward, I plan to iterate on this website and continuously improve it by making sure all aspects of this website are responsive, useful, and accessible.
